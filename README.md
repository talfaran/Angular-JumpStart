# Angular JumpStart - enhancement

The goal of this jumpstart-enhancement is to add the funtionality of adding new orders for a specific customer in the origin Jumpstart app.

## Running the Application

1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org. *IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need a current version of Node.js.*

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code

1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser 

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started. 

Once the app is running you can play around with editing customers after you login. Use any email address and any password that's at least 6 characters long (with 1 digit).
